# üç¥ UDConverter Fan Fork
**Interim version 0.1.1**

This Python package is a fork of the [UDConverter](https://github.com/thorunna/UDConverter) module, specifically the [UDconverter-GreynirCorpus](https://github.com/thorunna/UDConverter-GreynirCorpus) version of the module.

The package provides methods, tools and settings to automatically convert constituency-based syntax trees (either [IcePaHC format](https://linguist.is/wiki/index.php?title=Icelandic_Parsed_Historical_Corpus_(IcePaHC)) or [GreynirCorpus format](https://github.com/mideind/GreynirCorpus)) to the [Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org/) framework.

Although in (sporadic) development, **this package is only partially applicable for converting Icelandic treebanks to the UD framework** and is thus made available as is.

## Fork Purpose
The aim of this fork is to partially rebuild the original converter, to better expose individual parts of its functionality. 

In this approach, UDConverter can be installed as an individual package via pip, and specific methods can be imported and used in other projects as needed.

## Setup

The interim release of the package can be 

`pip install git+https://github.com/hinrikur/UDConverterFanFork.git@v0.1.1-interim`


## Acknowledgements

UDConverter is part of the UniTree project for IcePaHC, funded by The Strategic Research and Development Programme for Language Technology, grant no. 180020-5301. The original converter was improved and adapted to the GreynirCorpus format as part of the Language Technology Programme for Icelandic 2019-2023. The programme, which was managed and coordinated by Almannar√≥mur (https://almannaromur.is/), was funded by the Icelandic Ministry of Education, Science and Culture.
